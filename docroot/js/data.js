MENA is not a synonym for Arab Americans and/or Muslims. According to the American Arab Discrimination Committee (ADC), “Arab is a cultural and linguistic term. It refers to those who speak Arabic as their first language. Arabs are united by culture and by history. Arabs are not a race. Some have blue eyes and red hair; others are dark skinned; many are somewhere in between. Most Arabs are Muslims but there are also millions of Christian Arabs and thousands of Jewish Arabs, just as there are Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Americans” (2009). Muslims are a group united by religious identity, practices, and affiliation. MENA is an emerging racialized group, a group that shares experiences of categorization and discrimination based on the ways that they are being perceived by others. This timeline therefore includes diversity experiences of many groups of people that may or may not originally or currently self-identity specifically or primarily as MENA, but who are aggregated into this racialized group category.",
