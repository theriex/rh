MENA is not a synonym for Arab Americans and/or Muslims. According to the American Arab Discrimination Committee (ADC), “Arab is a cultural and linguistic term. It refers to those who speak Arabic as their first language. Arabs are united by culture and by history. Arabs are not a race. Some have blue eyes and red hair; others are dark skinned; many are somewhere in between. Most Arabs are Muslims but there are also millions of Christian Arabs and thousands of Jewish Arabs, just as there are Muslim, Christian, and Jewish Americans” (2009). Muslims are a group united by religious identity, practices, and affiliation. MENA is an emerging racialized group, a group that shares experiences of categorization and discrimination based on the ways that they are being perceived by others. This timeline therefore includes diversity experiences of many groups of people that may or may not originally or currently self-identity specifically or primarily as MENA, but who are aggregated into this racialized group category.",

This included a reversal of the Dawes Act's privatization of common holdings of American Indians and a return to local self-government on a tribal basis. It also restored to Native Americans management of their assets, mostly land, and included provisions for building a sound economic foundation for Indian reservation inhabitants.\nThe act did not require tribes to select a constitution. However, if the tribe chose to, the constitution had to; (1) allow the tribal council to employ legal counsel, (2) prohibit the tribal council from engaging any land transitions without majority approval of the tribe, and, (3) authorize the tribal council to negotiate with the Federal, State, and local governments. Evidently some of these restrictions were eliminated by the Native American Technical Corrections Act of 2003. The act slowed a practice of assigning tribal lands to individual tribal members, and reduced the divestiture of native holdings that were being lost through a practice of checkerboard land sales to non-members within tribal areas." },
