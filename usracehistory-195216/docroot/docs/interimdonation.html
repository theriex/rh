<p>If you are reading this, the PastKey project does not have fiscal
sponsorship yet and there's no donation page.  If you would like to contribute
in the meantime, all the work is being done
by <a href="https://epinova.com">epinova consulting</a> who would definitely
appreciate any donations. </p>
