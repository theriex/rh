Wall clock time values are represented using the Date.toISOString
representation with the millis truncated, followed by the timezone offset.
e.g. 2017-05-18T00:10:18Z240

Elapsed time values are integers representing tenths of seconds. So a value
of 34 would represent 3.4 seconds.  Elapsed time values max out at 99999
to save space since anything larger than that is kind of meaningless.

id = User's unique ID number. If progress has not been saved to the server
then the value is zero.  The id parameter is always listed first in the URL
so it can be found easily.

st = Start Time. The value is when the user first pressed the "Go" button.

Zero or more supplemental visualization parameter/value pairs in the same
order as declared in the data.  The parameter name is the suppvis code.  The
parameter value is the start time followed by a colon followed by the
elapsed time.  One suppvis per level, so this gives gross progress.
e.g. sl=2017-05-18T00:10:18Z240:3000

pb0 ... pbN Visited point blocks with max 100 points per block.  Points are
separated by colons.  Each point is viewtime + cid + 'r' (if remembered).
e.g. pb0="45N1:52N2:39B10r:..."
The cid always starts with a letter and ends with a number.
