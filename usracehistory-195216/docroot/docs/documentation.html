<p>The goal of the U.S. Race History Project is to provide timelines that
promote understanding and respect for the context of people whose histories
are frequently ignored.  To maximize impact, points are presented in a
compelling format with minimum required time commitment. </p>

<p>This site was motivated by a perceived need for historical context,
coupled with the difficulty of knowing where to start. </p>

<p>All timelines are incomplete. You are encouraged to check all points for
yourself. Knowledge evolves over time and history has multiple
perspectives. </p>


<div class="togdiv"><a href="#ack">Acknowledgements</a><div>

<p>The starting points for this timeline were compiled by Karen L. Suyemoto,
Ph.D. - UMass (Boston) Psychology and Asian American Studies. The points
were updated 2005-2006 by Claudia Fox Tree and Elli Stern for EMI Empowering
Multicultural Initiatives. The points were updated again in 2014 by Emily
Davis for K. Suyemoto. In 2017, I converted these points into an interactive
timeline and supporting visualizations, updating much of the data and
creating this public project. If you find anything problematic, please open
an issue (or comment on an existing issue) on
<a href="https://github.com/theriex/rh/issues">github</a>. </p>

<div class="togdiv"><a href="#ptsrc">Points and Timelines</a><div>

<p>Points for Timelines are contributed by member organizations. A subset of
all points are chosen for general quick reference.  All points are public
and can be used by anyone to create a timeline.  All timelines
are public and can be read by anyone. </p>
