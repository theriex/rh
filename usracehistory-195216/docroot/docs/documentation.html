<p>The goal of the PastKey project is to enable the creation of timelines
that promote understanding and respect for the context of people whose
histories are frequently ignored. </p>

<p>This site was motivated by a perceived need for historical context,
coupled with the difficulty of finding how to start. </p>

<p>All timelines are incomplete. You are encouraged to check points for
yourself. Knowledge evolves over time and history has multiple
perspectives. </p>


<div class="togdiv"><a href="#ptsrc">Points and Timelines</a><div>

<p>Points for Timelines are contributed by member organizations. A subset of
all points are chosen for general quick reference.  All points are public
and can be used by anyone to create a timeline.  All timelines
are public and can be read by anyone. </p>
